# Introduction To Object-Oriented Programming

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming model that organizes software around data, or objects. An *object* is a defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior. This model is used to keep our code organized and limit the amount of times we need to repeat ourselves

## What are Classes and Objects?

As briefly [discussed earlier](../Java-Fundamentals/course/Basic-Syntax.md), the class is the fundamental unit in Java used for storing our code. But what is a class *really*? A class is a way of structuring and storing information, as well as detailing and implementing ways to access and manipulate that [information](../Java-Fundamentals/course/Variables.md).
