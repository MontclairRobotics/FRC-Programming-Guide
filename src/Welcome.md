# Welcome!

This book was built by the programming leads of [Team 555 Montclair Robotics](https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/555) along with some [very special help](./Appendix/Special-Thanks.md) from others. The goal of this curriculum is to teach enough Java to get prospecting programmers with zero-experience to the level needed for complicated robotics development, as well as giving them the resources to continue their programming journey.

Until reaching the sections on [Git](./Git/Intro.md) or [FRC](./FRC/Intro.md) any code examples in the book can be run in [this](https://dev.java/playground/) online java playground. Feel free to mess around with any provided examples, they're built to be easy to change and experiment with.
