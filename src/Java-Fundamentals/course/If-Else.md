# Java Branching: If, If-Else
The statements inside your code are generally executed from top to bottom, in the order that they appear. Control flow statements, however, break up the flow of execution by employing decision making, looping, and branching, enabling your program to conditionally execute particular blocks of code. This page describes the most important decision-making statements (if, if-else). The [essential looping statements](./Loops.md) ([for](./Loops.md#for-loops), [while](./Loops.md#while-loops)) will be covered later. the most important looping statements (for, while), and the essential branching statements (break, continue) supported by the Java programming language.

## If Statement

The Java `if` statement is used to conditionally run code depending on if a boolean condition is true . It checks boolean condition: true or false. There are various types of if statement in Java.

> A condition in the context of control flow statements refers to any boolean expression (previously explained [here](./Boolean-And-Equality-Operators.md)) that evaluates to either `true` or `false`. Some examples include `2 > 3`, `x == 9`, `6 % 2 == 0`, and `x == 9 && y == 3`
