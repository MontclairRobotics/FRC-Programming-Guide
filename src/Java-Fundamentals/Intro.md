# What Is Java?
Java is a programming language, which means it's used to give instructions to a computer. The instructions for the computer are written out in lines of what is called code. Each line is an instruction (or multiple instructions) that the computer executes. 

Java code is run on the Java Virtual Machine ([JVM](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/jvm-works-jvm-architecture/)) which translates the Java code to 1s and 0s that a computer can understand.

We use Java with [WPILib](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/index.html) to program our robot. WPILib abstracts away many complex and hardware specific details, provides a predefined project structure, and many useful tools that would be difficult to make in house. This allow us to focus more on logic and cool features!

Java code is stored in the .java file format. Usually, each .java file contains a single *class*. We will talk more about classes later, for now it is important to know that there is one per file.
