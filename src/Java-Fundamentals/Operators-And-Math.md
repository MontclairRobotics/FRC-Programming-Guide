# Operators
Operators represent basic mathematical operations. Addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, and one other we'll get to later. Java follows PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication & Division, Addition & Subtraction)

Consider the following example:
```java
double x1 = -0.1
double x2 = 0.1
double y1 = 1
double y2 = 1.4
