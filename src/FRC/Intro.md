# WPILib 
> The WPI Robotics Library (WPILib) is the standard software library provided for teams to write code for their FRCÂ® robots. WPILib contains a set of useful classes and subroutines for interfacing with various parts of the FRC control system (such as sensors, motor controllers, and the driver station), as well as an assortment of other utility functions.


WPILib is open-sourced software that [as previously mentioned](../Java-Fundamentals/Intro.md) facilitates our interaction with the robot hardware. The following section will details how to install WPILib, how we interact with different components, and the final pieces of java you need to know to work on robots, congrats on making it this far!
