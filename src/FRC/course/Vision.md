# Vision
We use cameras on our robot for 2 main things:
* Displaying the feed to the driver, so they can see what's going on/
* Analyzing data from the feed using code.


## AprilTags
AprilTags are visual tags placed throughout the field at **predefined** locations that are easily recognizable by our robot.

AprilTags are similar to QR codes in that they can be recognized by a camera, but instead of leading to a website they instead have an ID (1, 2, 3, etc) that can be decoded by the camera.
