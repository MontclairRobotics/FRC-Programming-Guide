# What Is Java?
Java is a programming language, which means it's used to give instructions to a computer. The instructions for the computer are written out in lines of what is called code. Each line is an instruction (or multiple instructions) that the computer executes. 

Java code is run on the Java Virtual Machine ([JVM](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/jvm-works-jvm-architecture/)) which translates the Java code to 1s and 0s that a computer can understand.

We use Java with [WPILib](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/index.html) to program our robot. WPILib gets rid of major complexities relating to communicating and interacting with robot hardware and allows us to focus more on logic and cool features!
