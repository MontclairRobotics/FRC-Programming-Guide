# What Is Java
Java is a programming language, which means it's used to give instructions to a computer. The instructions for the computer are written out in lines of what is called code. Each line is an instruction (or multiple instructions) that the computer executes. 

Java code is ran on the Java Virtual Machine ([JVM](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/jvm-works-jvm-architecture/)) which translates the java code to 1s and 0s the computer can understand.


We use Java alongside with [WPILib](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/index.html) to program our robot. WPILib abstracts away some major complexities relating to communicating and interacting with robot hardware and allows us to focus more on logic and cool features!
