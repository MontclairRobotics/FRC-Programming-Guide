# Basic Java Syntax
Welcome! Work your way through this documentation chronologically and skip over any parts you already feel comfortable with. More resources explaining specific topics in depth can be found at the bottom of the page.


## Introduction
Consider the following code:
```java
class Program {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        //this is where the program starts
            doStuff();
    }
}
```

> There's a lot of symbols and words here you may not be familiar with yet, and that's ok! we'll work through it in the next few pages.
